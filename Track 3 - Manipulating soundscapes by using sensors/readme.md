# Manipulating soundscapes by using sensors
In this activity, students will participate in the creation of an interactive installation in which
the soundscapes recorded the day before in Gamla Stan will be used as sound materials.
The programming environment will be Pure Data and/or MaxMSP.
Inertial sensors, including those embedded in the participants' smartphones, will be used to
select/mix sounds and to manage certain sound parameters such as volume, equalization,
and spatialization.
